	</header>
		<p>Hello internet! You've landed on a very sacred place. A place that I like to call my basic website. True to it's title, this was written completely in HTML. No CSS, no JS. Might call it minimal even, information sharing at its basic level.</p>

	<h2><font color="#E07B4D">About Me</font></h2></li>
		Hi, I am Shivam Shekhar Soy, often going by SamIsTheFBI on the internet. I am a 19 year old guy from India who loves to tinker around with anything he gets his hands on, most especially computers and software. Apart from the obvious signs that I like anime-styled art, I also love playing games, jumping from one genre to the other.
	<h2><font color="#E07B4D">Purpose of this page</font></h2>
		I am sort of in the middle of finding that as well. I just happened to stumble upon this website that allows you free hosting. And applying all that high school HTML knowledge seemed like a good idea to me. Nothing to lose so here we are. Also, there is a possibility that I may refine this page and make it some sort of a portfolio website.
